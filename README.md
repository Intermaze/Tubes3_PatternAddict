## Description
This project is a biometric identification system utilizing fingerprint search, developed in C#, using 3 pattern matching algorithms: Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), Boyer-Moore (BM), and Regular Expressions (Regex). KMP is an efficient string matching algorithm that improves the search process by pre-processing the pattern to create a partial match table. Boyer-Moore is a highly efficient string search algorithm that skips sections of the text by using information gained during the matching process. Regex is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern, used here for string manipulation.
